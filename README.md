#tiny-crud-class-components

A tiny CRUD task list - code to help remember state and props with class components in React

[See it live here](https://mbeckdev.github.io/tiny-crud-class-components/)

## Why
- meant to help jog my memory if I ever need to remember the syntax of a React project using class components
- CRUD means an app that has these capabilities: Create, Read, Update, and Delete
- I made this when state and props wasn't making sense. Now it does. I like this little project.

## Note
- There are two extra class components inside of App.js  Typical React says that you should place these in separate files and import them into the App.js file.
- That means I'm doing it wrong. I'm keeping it as it is all in one file because it's easier to see in this project when it comes to figuring out state and props. 
- Don't do it like this in other projects!
