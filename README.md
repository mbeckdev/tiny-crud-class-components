#tiny-crud-class-components

A tiny CRUD task list - code to help remember state and props with class components in React

- meant to help jog my memory if I ever need to remember the syntax of a React project using class components
- CRUD means an app that has these capabilities: Create, Read, Update, and Delete
- I made this when state and props wasn't making sense. Now it does. I like this little project.
